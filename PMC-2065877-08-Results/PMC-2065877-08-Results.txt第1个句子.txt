RO1_ Promotes Tumor Growth and Survival through Activation of PRO2_, NFkappaB, and PRO3_ Pathways
To explore which pathways were required for the enhanced growth and survival of PRO4_-induced lymphomas, splenocytes from wild-type and PRO5_ transgenic mice were cultured in the presence of inhibitors for PRO6_, NFkappaB, PRO7_, PRO8_, or MAPK and assayed for growth and survival by the MTS assay.
