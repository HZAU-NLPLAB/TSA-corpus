Interestingly, both wild-type and PRO50_ transgenic lymphomas were similarly susceptible to triciribine, BAY11-7085, and cucurbitacin I treatments, but not SB202190, AG490, or U0126 treatment, suggesting that activation of PRO51_, NFkappaB, and PRO52_ but not MAPK pathways are characteristics associated with malignant transformation (Figure 7).
