Since the human genomic sterol regulatory element (SRE) has been shown to regulate various key genes involved in this phenomenon, the present study revealed the existence of a unique 47 kDa protein factor having affinity for this SRE sequence in lymphocytes from normal subjects, as well as its absence in lymphocytes from untreated CML patients.
