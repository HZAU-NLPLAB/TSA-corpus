
To detect expression of surface molecules, cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in FACS wash buffer (3% FBS, 0,1% sodium azide, 30 mM Hepes, 1x PBS) containing the antibodies indicated in the figures at previously optimized concentrations, incubated for 15 min at room temperature (RT),   washed, and resuspended in 2% formaldehyde fixative solution before acquisition on a FACSCalibur (BD).
