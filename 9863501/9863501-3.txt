Since human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication is known to be favored under oxidative stress conditions, ex vivo experiments using uninfected PBMCs, primary monocytes or a latently infected promonocytic U1 cell line show that HIV-1 replication and reactivation, monitored by p24 antigen measurement, are inhibited by PAO in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.
