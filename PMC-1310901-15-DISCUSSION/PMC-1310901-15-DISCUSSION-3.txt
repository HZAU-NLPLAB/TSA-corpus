We observed no genetic alterations in the PRO2_ promoter, which can account for the lack of PRO3_ expression: The detected base pair changes at position -1081 (T to C substitution), at position -1068 (A to C substitution) and at position -116 (A to C substitution) are unlikely responsible for absent PRO4_-expression since the first two mutations were found both in PRO5_-positive and -negative cells whereas the latter change was not detected consistently in all PRO6_-negative or -positive cells and may thus be a polymorphism.
