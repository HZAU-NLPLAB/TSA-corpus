Finally, comparison of the percent PRO10_+PRO11_+PRO12_+ T cells to the HTLV-I proviral load in HTLV-I-infected asymptomatic carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis suggested that high PRO13_ expression is associated with low proviral load and absence of disease.
