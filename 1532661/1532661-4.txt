For further mapping purposes, a fusion promoter was constructed with the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor basic promoter containing 60 base pairs of sequence upstream from the cap site of the mouse granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene and various lengths of the 5' upstream sequence of the IL-4 gene.
